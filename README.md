# e-plantShopping — Paradise Nursery

This project is a small React + Vite storefront for plants. I migrated the UI to Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive look.

Quick setup (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd .\e-plantShopping
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind and PostCSS configs are added (`tailwind.config.cjs`, `postcss.config.cjs`).
- Main stylesheet is `src/index.css` (Tailwind directives are included).
- Components have been refactored to use Tailwind utility classes.

If you want me to also run `npm install` here or commit the changes, tell me and I can provide the exact terminal commands to run locally.
